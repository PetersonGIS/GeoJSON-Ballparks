GeoJSON-Ballparks
=================

Ballparks of [MLB](http://mlb.com) and [Minor League AAA](http://www.milb.com/) teams in [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org).

The goal is to get all professional baseball team ballparks in GeoJSON format.  This includes the Mexican League](http://www.milb.com/index.jsp?sid=l125) as well as AA and A teams.  We'd also like to get independent baseball league teams in the database.
