GeoJSON-Ballparks
=================

Ballparks of [MLB](http://mlb.com) and [Minor League AAA](http://www.milb.com/) teams in [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org).

The goal is to get all professional baseball team ballparks in GeoJSON format.  This includes the [Mexican League](http://www.milb.com/index.jsp?sid=l125) as well as AA and A teams.  I'd also like to get independent baseball league teams in the database but they don't always play in the same ballparks year after year.

**Finished**

1. Major League Baseball (American League and National League)
2. Pacific Coast League (Class Triple-A)
3. International League (Class Triple-A)
4. Mexican League (Class Triple-A)
5. Eastern League (Class Double-A)
6. Southern League (Class Double-A)
7. Texas League (Class Double-A)
8. California League (Class A-Advanced)
9. Carolina League (Class A-Advanced)
10. Florida State League (Class A-Advanced)
11. South Atlantic League (Class A)
12. Midwest League (Class A)

**To-Do**
