GeoJSON-Ballparks
=================

Ballparks of [MLB](http://mlb.com) and [Minor League AAA](http://www.milb.com/) teams in [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org).

The goal is to get all professional baseball team ballparks in GeoJSON format.  This includes the [Mexican League](http://www.milb.com/index.jsp?sid=l125) as well as AA and A teams.  I'd also like to get independent baseball league teams in the database but they don't always play in the same ballparks year after year.

*Finished*

1. Major League Baseball (American League and National League)
2. Pacific Coast League (Class Triple-A)
3. International League (Class Triple-A)
4. Mexican League (Class Triple-A)
5. Eastern League (Class Double-A)

*Todo*

4. Florida State League (Class A-Advanced)
